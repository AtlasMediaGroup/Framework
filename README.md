# Caldera Community Framework

**Just Another PHP Framework...** [CCF](http://framework.calderams.com) is the base of many of our products, and so, it is just another everyday PHP framework.

## Goals

- **Fast and simple.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. CCF is built with PHP so it's quick and easy to deploy. Allowing you to develop web applications quickly and efficiently.
- **Templating & Skins.** Caldera Community Framework comes with a built in templating engine and skins, making themeing a cinch.
- **Powerful and extensible.** Customise, extend, and integrate CCF to suit your needs. CCF's architecture is amazingly flexible, prioritising comprehensive APIs and great documentation.
- **Authentication & Permissions.** Caldera Community Framework comes with powerful user authentication and permissions, saving you time, while providing a base to extend. Should you wish to not use this feature, simply don't use it, or just remove the package...simple.

## Installation

**Caldera Community Framework is currently in development and will be ready to use later this year.**

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions, big or small. However, we will only accept those that follow our guidelines.

All code must be written following the Stroustrup indent style. An example of this can be seen below:

 ```php
 if ($cond == true) {
   //...
 }
 else {
   //...
 }

 ```

Other guidelines we ask that you follow are:

- Booleans must be written in lower-case
- Class names must be declared using `StudlyCaps`
- Method names must be declared using `camelCase`
- Class constants must be declared in `CAPS` with underscores for separation
- The closing PHP tag `?>` must be omitted
- Only `<?php` and `<?=` are acceptable)!

Bug reports should go in [CalderaMS/framework](https://github.com/CalderaMS/framework/issues).
